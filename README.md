Beyond Sentiment: A Unified Model for Emotion Detection in Tweets!
 We developed a machine learning model capable of automatically classifying tweets into six distinct emotional categories (e.g., anger, joy, sadness) using a lightweight and efficient transformer-based model (DistilBERT). The goal is to assist in understanding public sentiment expressed on twitter (X) about a product or service, enabling actionable insights for businesses.
